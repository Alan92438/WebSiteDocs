            Reference types are easier to track than value types for the library, if in the
            example you are following the code is plotting a reference type point, like <i class="text-muted">ObservableValue</i> class and
            you are reproducing it but plotting double values instead, then you might get a different animation.

            Give it a try to <a href="/Licensing/Pricing">LiveCharts.Geared</a>, it is an independent package that boost the performance of the library,
            LiveCharts started as only good looking charts, performance was never the target, but then as the popularity of the library went up, I
            Beto Rodríguez was forced to add this package so the library was a full solution, the Geared package is a really solid alternative for
            high pricing libraries, the reason why I started this library is to avoid those huge prices, give it a try maybe it also helps you.
